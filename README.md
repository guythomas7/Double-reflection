Run the main code.

- R <- 2 near the top specifies the number of recursions of the pair of reflection operators.This needs to be at least: the number of times the fractional drawdown traverses from 1 to b. So if you set b closer to 1, you probably need to increase R (because more traversals from 1 to be are likely when 1 and b are close). 

Then graph the output using the graph code. At the top, RunNo <- 33 specifies the simulation correspnding to the graphs in my note (at least on my hardware).
